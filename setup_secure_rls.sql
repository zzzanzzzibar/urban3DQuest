-- Urban3DQuest - secure baseline with RLS + Supabase Auth admin role
-- Apply first in staging, then production.

begin;

-- 0) Admin role source of truth (Auth users mapped to admin privileges)
create table if not exists admin_users (
  user_id uuid primary key references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

alter table admin_users enable row level security;

drop policy if exists admin_users_self_read on admin_users;
create policy admin_users_self_read on admin_users
for select to authenticated
using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create or replace function public.is_admin()
returns boolean
language sql
stable
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
  select exists (
    select 1
    from public.admin_users a
    where a.user_id = auth.uid()
  );
$$;

grant execute on function public.is_admin() to anon, authenticated;

-- 1) Enable RLS on game tables
alter table if exists treasures enable row level security;
alter table if exists players   enable row level security;
alter table if exists events    enable row level security;
alter table if exists config    enable row level security;

-- 2) Drop old policies (idempotent)
drop policy if exists treasures_read_all on treasures;
drop policy if exists treasures_update_found on treasures;
drop policy if exists treasures_admin_all on treasures;

drop policy if exists players_read_all on players;
drop policy if exists players_insert_self on players;
drop policy if exists players_update_self on players;
drop policy if exists players_admin_all on players;

drop policy if exists events_read_all on events;
drop policy if exists events_insert_all on events;
drop policy if exists events_admin_all on events;

drop policy if exists config_read_all on config;
drop policy if exists config_admin_all on config;

-- 3) Public read access needed by the player app
create policy treasures_read_all on treasures
for select to anon, authenticated
using (true);

create policy players_read_all on players
for select to anon, authenticated
using (true);

create policy events_read_all on events
for select to anon, authenticated
using (true);

create policy config_read_all on config
for select to anon, authenticated
using (true);

-- 4) Player gameplay writes (limited)
create policy players_insert_self on players
for insert to anon, authenticated
with check (
  pseudo is not null
  and length(trim(pseudo)) between 2 and 24
  and pseudo ~ '^[A-Z0-9_-]+$'
);

create policy players_update_self on players
for update to anon, authenticated
using (true)
with check (
  pseudo is not null
  and length(trim(pseudo)) between 2 and 24
  and pseudo ~ '^[A-Z0-9_-]+$'
  and found_count >= 0
  and score >= 0
);

create policy events_insert_all on events
for insert to anon, authenticated
with check (
  pseudo is not null
  and length(trim(pseudo)) between 2 and 24
  and pseudo ~ '^[A-Z0-9_-]+$'
  and duration_sec is not null
  and duration_sec >= 0
);

-- Unique claim is protected in app by update ... eq('found_by','').
create policy treasures_update_found on treasures
for update to anon, authenticated
using (true)
with check (
  found_by is not null
);

-- 5) Admin writes: only authenticated users present in admin_users
create policy treasures_admin_all on treasures
for all to authenticated
using (public.is_admin())
with check (public.is_admin());

create policy players_admin_all on players
for all to authenticated
using (public.is_admin())
with check (public.is_admin());

create policy events_admin_all on events
for all to authenticated
using (public.is_admin())
with check (public.is_admin());

create policy config_admin_all on config
for all to authenticated
using (public.is_admin())
with check (public.is_admin());

-- 6) Storage hardening for admin uploads in bucket photos
drop policy if exists photos_admin_select on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists photos_admin_insert on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists photos_admin_update on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists photos_admin_delete on storage.objects;

create policy photos_admin_select on storage.objects
for select to authenticated
using (bucket_id = 'photos' and public.is_admin());

create policy photos_admin_insert on storage.objects
for insert to authenticated
with check (bucket_id = 'photos' and public.is_admin());

create policy photos_admin_update on storage.objects
for update to authenticated
using (bucket_id = 'photos' and public.is_admin())
with check (bucket_id = 'photos' and public.is_admin());

create policy photos_admin_delete on storage.objects
for delete to authenticated
using (bucket_id = 'photos' and public.is_admin());

-- Post-deploy checklist:
-- 1) Create an admin user in Supabase Auth (email/password).
-- 2) Insert that user's UUID into admin_users.
--    Example:
--    insert into admin_users(user_id)
--    values ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000');
-- 3) Test admin login in admin.html.
